Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

    Encapsulation: 
    Bundles data and methods in an object, hiding internal details and protecting data from outside interference.

    Abstraction: 
    Simplifies complex systems by modeling essential features, allowing focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

    Inheritance: 
    Allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another, promoting code reuse and creating class hierarchies.

    Polymorphism - Many forms: 
    Enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, allowing methods to be overridden or 
    overloaded for flexibility.

These pillars help create organized, reusable, and maintainable code.
